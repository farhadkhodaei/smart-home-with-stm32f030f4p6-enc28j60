# smart-home-with-stm32f030f4p6-enc28j60



Dear reader, Hi

This is a project for turning an LED (connected to PA4 GPIO pin of stm32f030f4p6 microcontroller) on or off by using ethernet or wifi connection. This operation can be done by a web browser run on a smartphone or a pc, connected to the ENC28J60 (that is interfaced with the used stm32f030 microcontroller) directly or by a wifi modem/router. You can find all things by loading the web page implemented by the microcontroller. Then you can open the Keil 4 project or STM32CubeMX project and view the source code. In the folder of f030 there is a STM32CubeMX project file that should be regenerated to have the remaining files and "Drivers" folder. The hardware should be implemented as follows: (see also http://farhadstore.ir)

PA4: the LED pin that is being on/off (on by making it low)

PA9: the CS pin of ENC28J60

PA10: the reset pin of ENC28J60

PA5,6,7: the SPI1 pins of the microcontroller connected to ENC28J60

This repository is a combination of two other repositories (main.c, network.c and network.h files from "bprayudha/avr-enc28j60" and enc28j60.c and enc28j60.h from "xaionaro/stm32-enc28j60" with little changes) that can be re-generated by STM32CubeMX, and also its webpage (implemented inside the microcontroller and written by HTML, Javascript and CSS) is new.
